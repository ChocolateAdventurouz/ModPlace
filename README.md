# ModPlace
Big Bento "Mod Menu"

Switch to "wacupfied" in order to get the mod
## Warning: Modplace is supported only on WACUPFied Big Bento (and WACUPFied Big Bento Redux) for 2 reasons:
1) I don't have the interest anymore to create things for the [so-called "Winamp"](https://twitter.com/0x5066/status/1552694428007112705) (Big Bento Redux for Winamp is included too) and 
2) It will have branding size problems, if you copy-paste `player-normal-mcv.xml`
